The Fraud Detection Tool is a web-based application built with Flask that identifies potential fraud cases in CSV transaction data. It supports both supervised (Random Forest) and unsupervised (Isolation Forest) machine learning models, automatically detecting whether the dataset includes a fraud label column (e.g., "Class", "Fraud"). Users can upload a CSV file, view detected fraud cases with probabilities, and download results as a CSV. The tool includes a user-friendly interface with performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy) for supervised models.
